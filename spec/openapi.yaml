    Welcome to the xMoney documentation for Developers. Here you will find
    everything you need to start accepting crypto payments in your online store
    or website easily with xMoney.


    # Basics

    In this section you can find a set of concepts that will help you understand
    how xMoney handles payments, so that you can integrate our payment method
    without any trouble.

    ## 0. Before you start

    Be aware xMoney Payments have the following limitations:

    > ⏰ Our payment confirmation can take **up to 2h**;

    > 🌍 Our Payment Widget is only available in **English**.


    ## 1. Checkout process

    Our payment flow is **asynchronous**; the customer chooses
    the cryptocurrency and issue a transaction in the respective blockchain,
    sending the requested funds to the address we provided.

    Once we detect the pending transaction, which usually happens in a matter of
    seconds, we recognize the payment and redirect the user to the merchant
    success callback URL.

    Upon confirmation of the transaction, which can take up to 2 hours, we send
    a notification to the merchant store or website via a [webhook](#section/Basics/5.-Webhooks).

    In more detail, this flow has 6 stages:

    <div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 28px auto;">
      <img src="diagram.png" alt="Checkout process diagram" />
    </div>

    1. [**Merchant**] On checkout, the merchant system sends the order details to
       create it on our server, getting a `redirect_url` in the response
       (see [the create order endpoint](https://docs.api.crypto.xmoney.com/#operation/createOrder)).
    2. [**Merchant**] Redirects users to the provided URL, which shows them the
       xMoney Payment widget.
    3. [**xMoney**] Users pay for the order, seeing a "Payment Complete"
       message. xMoney also sends them an email with the detected payment
       details. This completes the user interaction.
    4. [**xMoney**] Redirects the customer back to the `return_url` provided
       when the order was created.
    5. [**xMoney**] It takes some time to confirm transactions (minutes or hours,
       depending on the blockchain). Once confirmed, xMoney sends an HTTP
       request to the Merchant system notifying the payment was received.
    6. [**Store**] Verifies and validates the request, and, if valid, finalizes
       the order.


    ## 2. Try our flow

    The best way to learn about what we do is by trying it out yourself. For
    this, we recommend you to use [MultiversX Devnet wallet](https://devnet-wallet.multiversx.com/unlock/).
    To use it, you will get Devnet funds or some "fake" EGLD (notice Devnet instead of Testnet).
    After creating your wallet, on the right menu, find section "Sign Message". Below, click on "Faucet".
    Then click "Request tokens". This should get you 30 xEGLD (which is the fake EGLD you will need to test in Devnet).
    If that faucet is not working, you can try [this one](https://r3d4.fr/faucet) (don't forget to choose Devnet,
    as for MultiversX, it is the network we use for testing).

    ![Elrond_devnet_wallet](1_egld.png)

    You can also use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) with some fake ETH, just make sure to change to the Sepolia Testnet, which
    is what we use in our sandbox environment.

    When you are ready, go to our [Sandbox online store](https://sandbox.store.crypto.xmoney.com)
    and give it a spin by selecting an item and proceeding to checkout.
    Choose the xMoney payment method.
    Once you proceed to the payment, you will see xMoney Payment Widget.

    Confirm prefilled email or fill in the one you want to use.

    ![xMoney_payment_widget_email_constent](widget/01–widget–email_consent.png)

     Select Pay with another wallet.

    ![xMoney_payment_widget_method_selection](widget/02–widget–method.png)

    Select the EGLD (MultiversX) currency.

    ![xMoney_payment_widget_currency_selection](widget/03-widget-currency-selection.png)

    Select MultiversX network.

    ![xMoney_payment_widget_network_selection](widget/04-widget-chain-selection.png)

    The widget will then show you a QR Code with the
    payment details. Copy the address and amount.

    ![xMoney_payment_widget_qr-code](widget/05-widget-qr-code.png)

    Open Elrond wallet and send the amount in xEGLD to the provided address.

    ![Elrond_wallet_filled](2_egld.png)

    Wait some seconds, and the widget should change to show the payment is
    complete.

    ![xMoney_payment_widget_completed](widget/06–widget–wuccess.png)

    For EGLD, the payment is complete because transactions are confirmed very
    fast. For other cryptocurrencies, it can take some minutes to confirm. Either
    way, the confirmation notification will we delivered to the merchant server,
    via [webhook](#section/Basics/5.-Webhooks).


    ## 3. Build the order

    Assuming you now have a clear understanding of the flow, let's integrate
    your system.


    ### 3.1. Sandbox and Production

    In addition to the real-world payment processing environment - Production, xMoney offers
    developers an environment where they can test their integration using
    not-so-valuable test money. We call this environment Sandbox.

    The two environments are identical for most of the time, differing only in
    that Production uses blockchains mainnets, and Sandbox uses the respective
    testnets.

    However, please note that some currencies may not available in Sandbox
    due to the unavailability of their testnets. For example,
    Lightning Network cannot be used to test Bitcoin transfers in Sandbox,
    but is always available for testing in Production.

    We also release new features to Sandbox a bit before them reaching
    Production, but this usually happens in a couple of hours.

    Depending on which environment they want to target, developers must choose
    the appropriate hostname to target their requests. Production uses the
    `crypto.xmoney.com` domain, whereas Sandbox uses the `sandbox.crypto.xmoney.com` domain.


    ### 3.2. Sign up for Sandbox

    To use our Sandbox environment
    [first you need a merchant account](https://merchants.sandbox.crypto.xmoney.com/onboarding/sign-up).
    Remember Production is a separate environment, your real merchant account
    won't exist in Sandbox (but here you can have many).

    ![Merchant_Dashboard_signup](md/01-md-sign_up.png)


    ### 3.3. Authentication

    You must then generate credentials for your store, which can be done through
    your xMoney Merchant Dashboard. In there, go to the Integrations section, choose _Custom_ and click on the _Generate Credentials_ button.

    ![Merchant_dashboard_organization](md/02-md-integrations.png)

    You’ll then be shown the `API Key` and `Webhooks Secret` for your store.
    This information will not visible afterwards, make sure to save it.

    ![Merchant_dasboard_new_credentials](md/03-md-credential_confirmation.png)


    ### 3.4. Creating the order

    Orders are base concept to process payments in xMoney. To process a payment
    the system must first call the
    [create order endpoint](https://docs.api.crypto.xmoney.com/#operation/createOrder).

    The response will then contain a URL to which users must be redirected. When
    the payment is processed xMoney redirects the user back to the system, using
    the URLs provided.


    ### 3.5. Going into production

    All tests went good and you want to move into production? To create a `production` account [go here](https://merchants.crypto.xmoney.com/).
    You will have to generate your production API Key and Webhook secret in the Integrations page.
    If you need to add more users, please <a href="mailto:support@xmoney.com?subject=Need more users">let us know</a> and we will add them manually to the same Organization.


    ## 4. Checkout suggestions

    To increase conversions on the checkout page, we suggest you to add the following:
    - **Payment method name**: “Pay with Crypto” or xMoney — Pay with Cryptocurrencies” (if it’s not possible to add the xMoney logo)

      Have in mind the correct way to spell "xMoney":

      <img alt="How to write xMoney" style="max-width: 350px" src="spelling.png" />
    - **Description/Instructions**: “You will be redirected to the xMoney payment widget compatible with any major crypto wallets. It will allow you to pay for your purchase in a safe and seamless way using Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether or a number of other currencies. [What is xMoney?](https://xmoney.com/)”
    - **xMoney checkout logo**: Download the logos [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g3gpQ72kum3VwT0oVSJkK0iQOdjdgnwK?usp=share_link).

    Example with the xMoney logo:

    <img alt="Checkout with xMoney logo" style="max-width: 500px" src="checkout-logo.png" />

    Example without the xMoney logo:

    <img alt="Checkout without xMoney logo" style="max-width: 500px" src="checkout-no_logo.png" />


    ## 5. Webhooks

    Merchant systems can be notified of events in the xMoney platform through
    webhooks. At the moment these events include:

    - Confirmation of the order payment;
    - Cancellation of the order.

    The URL to use for these webhooks is defined by the `callback_url` field
    when creating an order.

    All webhook requests are expected to respond with HTTP status 2xx in case
    of success. Any other status code, or the lack of a response, will be
    considered a failure. In that case xMoney will retry up to 15 times with an
    exponential back off following a Fibonacci sequence -- first retry happens
    after 1 minute, second happens 2 minutes after the first one, third happens
    3 minutes after the second one, etc.

    All requests sent by xMoney to the provided URL are signed for validation
    using the `Webhooks Secret` generated (see [3.3
    Authetication](#33-authentication)).

    When using our [integrations](#section/Integrations), webhooks are set and
    validated automatically as part of the order payment flow. For custom
    integrations we make available [libraries](#section/Libraries) able to
    validate the requests.

    For manual validation instructions, and further technical details, check
    the [Webhooks](https://docs.api.crypto.xmoney.com/#tag/Webhooks) section in the
    [xMoney API](https://docs.api.crypto.xmoney.com) documentation.
